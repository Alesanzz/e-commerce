<p align="justify">A socket server is a software component that allows network communication between multiple clients and a server using the socket programming interface. The main features of a socket server typically include:

- Socket Creation: It creates a socket to listen for client connections.
- Connection Handling: It accepts and manages incoming client connections.
- Multithreading or Asynchronous Operations: It handles multiple client connections concurrently.
- Request Processing: It processes client requests according to the defined protocol or application logic.
- Data Serialization/Deserialization: It converts structured data for transmission over the network.
- Event Handling: It responds to events such as data arrival or client disconnection.
- Security: It ensures secure communication through encryption, authentication, and access control.
- Scalability: It handles a large number of client connections and distributes load if needed.
- Error Handling: It handles errors and provides appropriate responses to clients.
- Logging and Monitoring: It logs server activity and monitors performance.</p>
